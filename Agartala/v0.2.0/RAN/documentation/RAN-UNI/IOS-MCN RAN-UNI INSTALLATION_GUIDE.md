**INTRODUCTION**
==========================

The **IOS-MCN RAN Distributed Sub-Project** aims to deliver a
functional, high-performance, and easily deployable Radio Access Network
(RAN) based on open-source components such as OpenAirInterface5G
(OAI). This installation guide outlines the complete process required
to deploy a working 5G gNB (gNodeB) node capable of interacting with
either a physical RU (Radio Unit) like LPRU or software-defined radio
hardware like USRP B210.

The guide includes setup for both **Split 7.2** and **Split 8**
configurations:-

**In Split 7.2,** the L1 PHY is split up, and Fronthaul
communication is handled over **e-CPRI** (Ethernet using a dedicated PHY
interface library).

**Split 8** setups are typically used with SDRs like USRP, where the PHY
resides on the centralized gNB machine.

This release package includes all the required binaries, shared
libraries, and example configuration files needed to run the
nr-softmodem application, the main executable for the 5G gNB
implementation.

The setup is optimized for **low-latency, high-throughput performance**
on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with **real-time kernel** support, DPDK-based
user-space networking, and **BIOS-level optimizations**. It also covers
advanced configurations such as CPU core isolation, clock
synchronization using PTP, and Dockerized deployment for reproducibility
and isolation.


**CHAPTER-2**
======

**BACKGROUND**
==========================

This chapter provides a foundational understanding of the 5G RAN system
architecture and outlines the hardware and software environment used for
the deployment described in this guide.

**2.1 RAN ARCHITECTURE:**
-

The **Radio Access Network (RAN)** in 5G is designed to support flexible and scalable deployment through functional splits between the Central Unit (CU), Distributed Unit (DU), and Radio Unit (RU).
>
Depending on performance and latency needs, different splits can be used:

-   **Split 8 (Full Centralization):**
    > The PHY and upper layers are handled by a centralized gNB. This
    > configuration is suitable for software-defined radios like the
    > **USRP B210**, where the signal processing stack runs entirely on
    > the host machine.

-   **Split 7.2 (Fronthaul PHY Interface):**
    > The lower PHY functions (FFT/IFFT, PRACH, etc.) are offloaded to a
    > Remote Radio Unit (e.g., LPRU), while high PHY& higher layers are
    > centralized in the gNB. This setup uses an Ethernet-based
    > fronthaul with a dedicated PHY library for communication.

> In this project, both splits are supported using OpenAirInterface5G (OAI), with a dynamic linking model to choose between USRP-based deployment and LPRU-based deployment, depending on the selected configuration.

**Note**: These are not minimum hardware requirements.This is the configuration of our servers

**5.1. DPDK Installation**
-----
In a softwareâdefined RAN, the RAN application (e.g.â¯OAI's
nrâsoftmodem) must move packets between the baseband processing and
the NIC at very high rates (tens of Gbps) with minimal
latency---kernelâbased network stacks simply can't keep up. Installing
and using DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) gives you:

-   **Kernel Bypass & UserâSpace Packet I/O**

    > DPDK libraries let your application talk directly to the NIC hardware
    > (viaâ¯VFIO or UIO drivers) instead of going through the Linux kernel's
    > networking stack. This avoids context switches, copyâin/copyâout, and
    > perâpacket interrupts.

-   **ZeroâCopy, Batch Processing**

    > Packets are received in large bursts into hugeâpage--backed memory
    > pools (mbufs) you manage in user space. You can process dozens or
    > hundreds of packets with a single API call, rather than oneâ¯recv()
    > call per packet.

-   **PollâMode Drivers**

    > Instead of interruptâdriven I/O, DPDK uses tight polling loops on
    > dedicated CPU cores. This ensures deterministic latency (no interrupt
    > latency jitter) and very high throughput---critical for realâtime 5G
    > PHY processing.

-   **Huge Pages & NUMA Awareness**

    > By allocating packet buffers in 2â¯MB or 1â¯GB pages, DPDK minimizes TLB
    > misses and maximizes memory bandwidth. You can pin memory and cores
    > per NUMA node to get consistent performance on multiâsocket servers.

-   **Hardware Offload Support**

    > DPDK exposes NIC offloads---checksum, segmentation, RSS, flow
    > steering---in a unified API, allowing your softmodem to leverage
    > hardware acceleration features without complex kernel configuration.

**Steps to install DPDK:**
-

-   **DPDK (Data Plane Development kit):**

    ```
    sudo apt install wget xz-utils libnuma-dev
    sudo apt install meson
    wget http://fast.dpdk.org/rel/dpdk-20.11.9.tar.xz
    ```

-   **DPDK Compilation**

**RUNNING THE RAN APPLICATION**
=====
**6.1.USRP Configuration**
----

 This section describes the procedure to execute the nr-soft modem
binary build for USRP b210 board. For execution we need to connect
 b210 on the machine on USB port 3.0.

![](../../documentation/RAN-UNI/images/ran_installation/image10.png)

Figure 9 USRP B210 to gNB hardware connection diagram

**Package Information:**

**Download the tar file from the Official channel**
(wget https://github.com/ios-mcn/ios-mcn-releases/tree/main/Agartala/v0.2.0/RAN/release-images/RAN-UNI/ios-mcn-ran-uni-baremetal-v0.2.0.tar.gz)

Copy the tar file to the target gNB machine (/home/$user/) .Untar the file using cmd.

```
tar -xvzf ios-mcn-ran-uni-baremetal-v0.2.0.tar.gz
cd final_artifact
```

> In case of USRP we don't need any fronthaul binary .We just need to set the dynamic linking of the shared libraries as shared in the package.

> Set the shared library linking using utility patchelf. You can install this utility using cmd.

```
sudo apt install patchelf
sudo patchelf --set-rpath <complete path to package><artifact(nr-softmodem)>
```

**After that start the nr-softmodem:**
```
cd final_artifact
sudo taskset -c 10 ./nr-softmodem -O ./<configuration file> --sa -E --usrp-tx-thread-config 1 --thread-pool 3,4,5   #conf filw cand be found in the Ran.source package under the openairinterfacev0.2.0/ci-scripts 
```

**Note: The argument to run nr-softmodem binaries are different for
 USRP you can see argument are different and for LPRU Argument passed
in the command are different.**

**6.2. LPRU Configuration:**
--
 **Before configuring the LPRU we need to run the following commands to make our system(gNB) ready on a configuration level and to synchronize the clocks with respect to the Grandmaster switch which provides GPS signals.**

 **The commands and their description in detail is noted down below:**

1.  run: 
   ```
   sudo ./test.sh
```

This script test.sh configures the 5G gNB system
to work with the LPRU by disabling NTP, setting high MTU and buffer
values, enabling CPU performance mode, and setting up static routes to
IOSMCN-CORE. It also applies essential kernel parameters like BBR and
forwarding. The script ensures synchronization with the Grandmaster
clock and prepares the system for real-time 5G processing. Unsafe
noiommu mode is enabled to support VFIO-based device access.
    
![](../../documentation/RAN-UNI/images/ran_installation/image11.png) 

Figure 10	Contents of the test.sh script for system initialization

![](../../documentation/RAN-UNI/images/ran_installation/image12.png)

 Figure 11	Route creation output after running test.sh script

2.  run:
 ```
 sudo./vf.sh
```
 This script prepares the enp2s0f1 NIC for DPDK-based high-speed data
 plane communication by configuring advanced features such as MTU,
 SR-IOV, VLAN tagging, spoof check disablement, and MAC assignment.

   It enables 2 Virtual Functions (VFs), configures their VLANs and
    trusted modes, and then binds them to vfio-pci drivers using
    dpdk-devbind.py to offload traffic to user space with near real-time
    performance. These settings are crucial for gNB--LPRU data paths,
    especially when handling massive traffic in 5G.

**Then, check whether the function has been created.**
>
> **Run command in terminal:**
```
 ip link show
 ```

![](../../documentation/RAN-UNI/images/ran_installation/image15.png) 

Figure 14	Output of ip link show displaying virtual function interfaces


3.  Run: 
``` 
   sudo ./slave-enp2s0fo.sh
```
 This command runs ptp4l to make the gNB a PTP slave to the Fibrolan Grandmaster using the G.8275.1 telecom profile, which provides accurate phase and frequency synchronization. It binds the PTP process to CPU core 2 for better real-time performance and uses the network
interface enp2s0f0 for PTP packets. This synchronization is essential for TDD-based 5G systems to ensure time alignment across gNB and LPRU.

![](../../documentation/RAN-UNI/images/ran_installation/image16.png)

Figure 16	Output after executing slave PTP configuration script

4.  Run: 
   
```
sudo ./master-enp2s0f1.sh
```
 This command runs ptp4l to make the gNB act as a PTP master for the
 VVDN LPRU using the G.8275.1 clock profile. It uses interface enp2s0f1
 and pins the process to core 2 for better timing precision. This
 ensures accurate time distribution from the gNB to the LPRU, enabling
 proper synchronization for 5G operations.

Figure 18	Output of master PTP script to sync LPRU via gNB

5.  Run : 
```
sudo ./phc2sys-master.sh
```
 This command runs **phc2sys** to synchronize the gNB's system clock
 with the hardware clock of interface enp2s0f1, using the G.8275.1
 profile. It ensures tight timing accuracy when the gNB is acting as a
 PTP master. The process is pinned to core 2 for consistent execution
 and uses fine-grained sync parameters to maintain real-time clock
 precision.

**To access this LPRU (LOW POWER RADIO UNIT),**
-
  
**We need to ssh into the machine with the below provided details:**


-   Username - **root**

-   IP Address - **192.168.4.50**

-   Password: **vvdn**

Figure 21	Logging into LPRU terminal

**Logging into the terminal of the LPRU:**

Once you are logged in, Follow the below provided steps to sync up the LPRU, this includes the synchronization of radio unit, the compression setting , RF antenna configuration, channel parameters and other things.

>**1. To track synchronization progress in real-time by filtering sync-related log entries until the system achieves synchronization.Run command:**
>
 
```
tail -f/var/logs/synctiming2.log| grep sync
```
**We will wait until the unit synchronizes.**

- This command continuously monitors (tail -f) the **synctiming2.log**
file and filters out lines that contain the word sync. You're
essentially waiting and watching until a synchronization message
appears in the log.

- **You can also physically check the bottom most LED on the LPRU.**

 - **It blinks red when the RU is not synchronized, and turns green when
 it is synchronized**


>   **2. To parse and load the e_2x2.xml configuration file for applying
    system or test setup parameters.Run command:**

  ```
  xml_parser e_2x2.xml
  ```

- **Depending on whether we are running SISO (1x1) or MIMO (2x2) and e/f
Fronthaul Interface**

- **For 1x1 use e_1x1.xml, for 2x2 use e_2x2.xml (both for phy-e/phy-f),**

- **This command runs an XML parser tool to read and process the e_2x2.xml configuration file, which likely contains parameters or settings (e.g., antenna config, MIMO setup) used in the 5G lab environment.**

> **3. To write the value 1919 to memory address a0010024 for configuring a
> specific hardware register or system setting that helps in compressing the data (e.g., I/Q samples) transmitted between the DU (Distributed Unit) and the RU (Radio Unit) over fronthaul interfaces (typically using the eCPRI or ORAN protocols). Run command:**
```
  mw.l a0010024 1919
```
- **This command writes the value 1919 to the memory address a0010024
using the mw.l (memory write long) command. It's typically used to
configure hardware registers, initialize components, or change
settings in embedded/5G systems.**

    editor and To configure and activate transmit carrier parameters ---
    including center frequency, bandwidth, duplex scheme, and RF gain
    --- by editing the system configuration and setting the carrier
    status to ACTIVE, thereby completing the RU's channel setup for 5G
    NR transmission. Run command:**
```
sysrepocfg --edit=vi -d running
```

- **Change 'INACTIVE' to 'ACTIVE' at two places and save the file.**

- **This command opens the running datastore of Sysrepo (a YANG-based
 configuration datastore) for editing using the vi editor. It's used
to view or modify the current live configuration of a network
component or service.**

**7.2. Checking the configuration file parameters & Running the
gNb:**
--

> **7.2.1** Change the AMF IP in the gNB conf file **(test-xx.conf)** to the IP that is mentioned in the above step.
>
> **7.2.2** Check the **GNB_IPV_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF** and **GNB_IPV_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU** and set it to the IP of the gNB Machine (Here it is **[192.168.108.149]{.underline}**)

![](../../documentation/RAN-UNI/images/ran_installation/image31.png)

 Figure 29	Checking gNB configuration file parameters before launch
 
> **7.2.3** Run the **nr-softmodem** using the following command to start the gNB

```
sudo taskset -c 10 ./nr-softmodem -O ./<name_of_the_configuration>.conf --sa --reorder-thread-disable 1 --thread-pool 3,4,5,7
```


> The command runs the nr-softmodem process on CPU core 10 with specific
 configuration and optimization options. It disables thread reordering
 and assigns threads to a pool of CPU cores (3, 4, 5, 7). This setup is
 used to optimize the performance and latency of the softmodem in a 5G
 network environment.

**DOCKERIZED RAN GUIDE**
=====
This chapter provides the steps to deploy the containerized Docker
version of the UNI_RAN software instead of directly installing on the
host machine.

**NOTE:**

For RAN, the container needs **privileged access**, **real-time
scheduling**, and **access to host devices** like NICs (/dev/bus/usb,
/dev/net/tun, or PCI devices). That's why --privileged, --cap-add, and
network_mode: host are typically used in the Docker config.

If you face any diificulty in running the Dockerized version please refer to the Developer Guide & the Troubleshooting Guide.

This process of running the RAN can be achieved by following the
step-by-step guide mentioned below:

**8.1.Load the docker image:**
---

> **8.1.1.** Copy your RAN image tar file onto the host machine. 

> **8.1.2.** Load it into Docker:
```
sudo docker load -i /path/to/ran-gnb.tar
```
> **8.1.3.** Verify it's loaded
```
sudo docker images
```
**8.2.Prepare the Host Environment:**
---

> **8.2.1.** Copy the **USRP gnb config** and **LPRU config file** in the same path.

-   create a file name **usrp_initialstart.sh** with following content
```
#!/bin/bash
sudo timedatectl set-ntp false
sudo ldconfig
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=62500000
sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=62500000
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=62500000
sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_default=62500000
sudo sysctl -w net.core.default_qdisc=fq
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1
sudo ufw disable
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance -u 4.70GHz -d 4.70GHz
sudo cpupower idle-set -D 0
```

**8.3 Creating a docker-compose.yaml file:**
---

> The user should create a **docker-compose.yaml** file which allows the user to define, configure and manage your RAN container in a clear and structured way.
>
> Also you can reliably relaunch the same RAN every time with the below
> provided content, without manually typing docker run commands.

```

**Change the serial no. [3441CB] to the usrp actual serial no. present in your setup.**

**8.4. Launch the Container:**
-----
 With the below mentioned command the user can launch the 5G RAN node
inside a prepared container, wires up its configuration and hardware,
and also logs the boot process that will enable the user to a fully
 containerized and reproducible deployment

```
docker-compose up | tee output.txt
```
